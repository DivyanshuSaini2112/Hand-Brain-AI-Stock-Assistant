  <h3>Intelligent Trading Decisions with AI Precision</h3>
</div>

## Overview

Hand&Brain is an AI-powered trading assistant that uses advanced predictive technology to provide data-driven investment decisions. The platform combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to deliver personalized stock recommendations based on three key factors:

- Investment amount
- Risk tolerance
- Time horizon for returns

## Key Features

- **Advanced AI Models**: Hybrid model combining cGANs and Reinforcement Learning
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Custom stock suggestions based on user profile and goals
- **Real-time Market Analysis**: Integration with financial news and market trends
- **Trading Account Integration**: Monitor historical transactions for better predictions
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Continuous learning to improve recommendations over time
- **User-friendly Interface**: Accessible for both casual investors and serious traders

## Technical Architecture

Hand&Brain's prediction engine utilizes state-of-the-art AI techniques:

### Conditional GANs (cGANs)
- Generate realistic market scenarios for various conditions
- Simulate market behaviors close to real-world conditions
- Create plausible future price movements across normal and volatile periods

### Reinforcement Learning
- Sequential decision-making optimized for trading environments
- Agent learns optimal buy/sell strategies through interaction with simulated data
- Adapts strategies based on user preferences and market conditions
- Utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enhance stability during market volatility
